## Requirements

- Go 1.23+ (for building the project)

## Setup

The application now uses a YAML-based configuration file for improved clarity and flexibility. Replace the .env file with config.yml as described below.

1. Create the YAML configuration file:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/jira-work-log-sender
cp config.dist.yml ~/.config/jira-work-log-sender/config.yml
```

2. Edit config.yml (~/.config/jira-work-log-sender/config.yml) to match your environment. Here’s a breakdown of the fields:
```yaml
jira:
    url:   "https://jira.example.com"   # Base URL for your Jira instance.
    user:  ""                           # Your Jira username or email.
    token: ""                           # API token for authenticating requests.

highlighting:
    defaultThresholdHours: 16           # Number of hours after which tickets are highlighted.
    tagSpecificThresholds:
        "[Research&Investigation]": 24  # Number of hours after which tickets with specific tags are highlighted.
    excludedIssues:                     # List of Jira issue IDs excluded from highlighting.
        - "ISSUE-123"

timeAdjustment:
    enabled: true                       # Enable or disable time modification.
    excludedIssues:                     # List of Jira issue IDs excluded from time modification.
        - "ISSUE-456"
    targetDailyMinutes: 480             # Target time in minutes you want to log on daily bases. This param will be used in modification and highlighting.
    remainingTimeThreshold: 45          # Threshold in minutes for highlighting remaining time. If the remaining time exceeds this limit, it will be displayed with a yellow highlight.

input:
    worklogFile: "Icloud/Documents/IA-writer/2. My day.md"
                                        # Relative path to your daily Markdown work log file.
                                        # A relative path from your home directory.

cache:
    directory: ".config/jira-work-log-sender/cache"
                                        # Relative path to the cache directory.
                                        # A relative path from your home directory pointing to the cache directory (this directory must exist).

tags:
    allowed:                            # You may leave it empty and app won't validate tags.
        - "[Engineering activities]"    # List of allowed tags for work log descriptions.
        - "[Documentation]"
        - "[Deployment&Monitoring]"
        - "[Research&Investigation]"
        - "[Code review]"
        - "[Communication]"
        - "[Environment Issue]"
        - "[Operational work]"
        - "[Other]"
```

3. **Install Go dependencies**:

```shell
go mod download
```

4. **Build the project**:

```shell
make build
```

5. **Install (move) the binary** to your `$PATH` (example for macOS):

    sudo mv ./bin/app /usr/local/bin/tt

   *You can rename `app` to any alias you prefer, such as `tt`.*

6. **Run the application**:

```shell
tt
```

Congratulations! You’re ready to start logging your work.

## Usage

1. **Create or open your `.md` file** (pointed to by `PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE`) and fill it with your daily tasks.  
   For example:

```markdown
#  Worklogs

##  T1 - Time | ISSUE-987 10m
[Communication]
- Communication with team. Emails reading
- Daily meeting

##  1 - You task title (just for you) | ISSUE-12345 7h40m
[Engineering activities]
- Worked on something important
- Added something new
- Fixed something broken
```

   > **Tip:** The `# Worklogs` heading is required. Each work log entry starts with `##`, followed by `Name | ISSUE-ID Time`.

2. **Run the application**:

```shell
tt
```

3. **View the parsed logs** and confirm before sending:

```
┌─  Work Logs for Today  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌────────────────────────────┬────────┬────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐ │
│ │ Name                       │ T      │ MT     │ Issue       │ Description │ │
│ ├────────────────────────────┼────────┼────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤ │
│ │ T1 - Time | ISSUE-987 10m  │ 10m    │ 10m    │ ISSUE-987   │ [Communicat │ │
│ │ 1 - You task title (just f │ 7h 40m │ 7h 50m │ ISSUE-12345 │ [Engineerin │ │
│ └────────────────────────────┴────────┴────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘ │
│   Total time: 7h 50m │ Left: 0h 10m │ Total modified time: 8h 0m             │
│                                                                              │
│                                                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

   - **Name**: A descriptive name (for your reference).
   - **T**: The original time you wanted to log.
   - **MT**: The modified time (if you have leftover hours to reach 8 hours, it’s automatically distributed).
   - **Issue**: The Jira ticket ID.
   - **Description**: The tags or activities you performed.

4. **Send work logs** to Jira by pressing `l` twice. You’ll see a result screen like this:

```
┌─  Send Work Logs  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌────┬─────────────┬────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┐                   │
│ │ #  │ Issue       │ MT     │ Send status   │ Total time    │                   │
│ ├────┼─────────────┼────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┤                   │

│ │ 2  │ ISSUE-12345 │ 7h 50m │ Done!         │ n/a           │                   │
│ └────┴─────────────┴────────┴───────────────┴───────────────┘                   │
│                                                                                 │
│                                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
